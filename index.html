        <h3>I started taking classes at Bitwise because I was tired of always looking for web designers and developers to handle my website.  It had been so frustrating having to get these people because of their high fees they charge.  I told a friend of mine and he asked me to hook up with Geekwise. This is my second month here and I am enjoying it.</h3>
